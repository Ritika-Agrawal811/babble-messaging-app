## Accessibilty

Accessibility refers to the design and implementation of products, services, environments, and technologies in a way that ensures they can be used by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities.

The goal of accessibility is to create an _inclusive experience_ that accommodates a wide range of needs and abilities.

**Web Accessibility** : We must follow _Web Content Accessibility Guidelines_ (WCAG) to make the website usable for people with disabilities.

This includes providing alternative texts for images, ensuring content is navigable by keyboard, and making sure that web pages are readable by screen readers.

## Memoization

Memoization is an optimizing technique where information is stored in a cache and retrived from it when the same information is requested again _without_ needing to compute it again.
